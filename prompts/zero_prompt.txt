"A novice programmer has written a program that contains errors and fails to pass all the test cases for the problem.
Please identify the potential errors in the program and specify the line numbers where the errors occur.

You need to complete two steps:

1.Identify five lines in the program that may contain potential errors.
2.Rank these line numbers in descending order of the likelihood of the errors occurring."

You should return the result in a JSON format that can be parsed by json.load() faultyLoc.
The faultyLoc queue should contain five JSON objects, each with two fields:
"faultyLine" (indicating the line number of the potentially faulty code),
"explanation" (explaining why this line is suspected to be erroneous).
